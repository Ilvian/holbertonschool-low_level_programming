In the C programming language, a singly linked list is a common data structure that consists of nodes, where each node has a data field and a "next" field. The "next" field points to the next node in the list. The list starts with a head node and ends with a tail node, which points to NULL.

Here is a simple definition for a node in a singly linked list:

c
Copy code
struct Node {
    int data; // data field
    struct Node* next; // pointer to the next node
};
To traverse this list from the head to the tail, you might use a function like this:

c
Copy code
void printList(struct Node* n) {
    while (n != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", n->data);
        n = n->next;
    }
}
This function starts at the head of the list (or whatever node you pass it) and moves through the list by following the "next" pointers until it reaches the end of the list (signified by a NULL pointer).
